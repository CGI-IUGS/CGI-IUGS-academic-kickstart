Geoscience Domain Working Group
===============================

The [Geoscience Domain Working Group](https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/geosciencedwg) (DWG) is a working group of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) that is co-chaired by OGC and CGI. It aims to connect people to develop, improve and promote technologies for geoscience data description and sharing.

The DWG will:

*   develop communications materials that focus on the technical problem area of geoscience data management and exchange
*   engage members of the geospatial data community (including relevant OGC working groups) and the geoscience community
*   conceive, design, coordinate and implement projects that demonstrate technical approaches to geoscience data management and exchange within the context of the OGC suite of technologies and other relevant emerging technologies
*   as appropriate, serve as a forum for the development of specification profiles and application schemas for geoscience purposes

The DWG maintains an [OGC mailing list](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/?m=projects&a=view&project_id=539) (requires an OGC login) and is currently chaired by Mickaël Beaufils from BRGM. Read [Mickaël’s presentation](https://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/pub/GeoScienceDWG/WebHome/OGC_GeoScience_Standards_AGU2018.pdf) illustrating the linkages between CGI, OGC, and other related projects.

Borehole Interoperability Experiment
------------------------------------

The Geoscience DWG is currently undertaking a [Borehole Interoperability Experiment](https://github.com/opengeospatial/boreholeie). This activity aims to clarify the commonalities between several existing data standards for describing a borehole, its associated data and their position along a borehole, including some OGC and CGI standards such as GroundwaterML and GeoSciML. These approaches are largely restricted to a specific borehole viewpoint (e.g. groundwater, petroleum, engineering). The IE aims to provide a semantic umbrella linked to the pre-existing work by distilling the core elements shared by all disciplines.

To join the Borehole Interoperability Experiment (with or without an OGC login), contact the project leader [Sylvain Grellet](mailto:S.Grellet@brgm.fr) (BRGM).
