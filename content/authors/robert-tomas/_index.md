Robert holds an MSc in Geochemistry and a PhD in Geoinformatics. Prior joining the European Commission in 2009 he worked for 13 years in the Czech Geological Survey (CGS). As CGS Deputy Director for Informatics from 2001, Robert was responsible for development, implementation and operation of company- to national-scale applications and GIS systems. He has also been involved in several EU projects helping to increase the interoperability of geoscience data and services, such as OneGeology-Europe, GEOMIND, and AEGOS. Robert was one of the founding members of the OneGeology global project, and is a member of the OneGeology Operational Management Group.

Since 2003, Robert has represented the CGS in the Geoscience Information Consortium (GIC) - the global group of geoscience information managers of geological survey organizations. In 2008 he was elected the Executive Secretary of GIC and has served in the role for two consecutive terms that will finish in 2013.

At the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Robert has joined the INSPIRE development and coordination team responsible for the development of the INSPIRE Data specifications - the European legally binding implementing rules, for exchange of geology, mineral resources, soil and natural risk zones data and services. Robert is also involved in the data quality and metadata aspects of global spatial data infrastructures.
