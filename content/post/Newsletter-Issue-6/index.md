Welcome to Edition #6 of the CGI Newsletter. We report on the progress of the CGI Working Groups and recent meetings of CGI members.

## CGI Supports Interoperabity projects**

In 2021 the CGI grant was awarded to two data interoperability projects of high relevance to CGI work:

### Docker Packages  (Geological Survey of Canada)

The project will package ERML and GeoSciML service inside docker images. Containerisation, technology that allows to deploy self contained services and GeoSciML alternate encoding has been kick started with first assessment of issues.    Discussion material is published on OGC GitHub <https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoSciML/blob/master/geojson/REAME.MD>

A new publication will be released soon on Geology ontology (Brodaric and Richard) developed under the project LOOP3D's Geoscience Knowledge manager.  The ontology (knowledge representation) is built on top on several initiatives, including GeoSciML model and GeoSciML vocabularies.  (<https://github.com/Loop3D/GKM>) . 

### Vocabulary Improvement Acceleration (British Geological Survey)

> The project will update and then publish SKOS-RDF files for all
> vocabularies with translated Multi-Lingual Thesaurus of Geosciences
> terms and links added to related INSPIRE vocabularies. Github
> architecture will be streamlined for vocabulary hosting, customised
> vocprez instance and deployment to
> <http://cgi.vocabs.ga.gov.au/vocab/>

## Upcoming Events

CGI webinar on 23 June 2021 featuring the working groups:

-   GeoSciML Standards
-   EarthResourceML
-   Geoscience Terminology
-   CGI/OGC Geoscience Domain
-   Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Standards Task Group

## CGI Council News

The CGI Council held its 2020 annual meeting via zoom in October. The councillors discussed council membership, activities for CGI funding in 2021 and the need to recruit and rejuvenate active membership.

-   better promotion of CGI activities and standards

New councillors joined CGI. The current council members are:

-   Harvey Thorleifson - Chair
-   Kombada Mhopjeni - Co-Secretary
-   Zhang Minghua - Co-Secretary
-   Mark Rattenbury -- Treasurer
-   Kazu Miyazaki
-   Christelle Loiselet
-   Eric Boisvert
-   Edd Lewis

Past chair, François Robida and councillors - Ollie Raymond and David Percy remain as observers.

Since then the council held three business meetings addressing review of CGI grant proposals, status of CGI activities, increasing CGI visibility and membership in CGI working groups.

### Meet Your CGI Councillors

**Harvey Thorleifson** is the new Chair of CGI. Since 2003, Harvey has been Director of the Minnesota Geological Survey in the USA, State Geologist of Minnesota, and Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Minnesota. His undergrad and Masters were completed in Canada, his PhD is from the University of Colorado in Boulder, and from 1986 to 2003, he was a Geological Survey of Canada research scientist.

height="2.361111111111111in"}

He is Information Committee Chair for the Association of American State Geologists (AASG), and he completed two terms with the US National Geospatial Advisory Committee. He was a member of a National Academy panel that prepared a report on the international role of the US Geological Survey, and he was a member of the team that launched OneGeology. Harvey was 2003-2004 President of the Geological Association of Canada, 2004-2006 President of the Canadian Geoscience Council, and 2012-2013 President of AASG.

Harvey was excited to have joined CGI leadership in 2016, and is now pleased and humbled to follow Past CGI Chair François Robida, whose superb leadership will be a model for Harvey to aspire to. In his work, Harvey's focus has been on accelerating static-publication-based geological mapping, enhanced development of and adherence to standards, and accelerated provision of regularly-updated, seamless geological mapping databases assembled from many published geological maps. Contact [Harvey](mailto:thorleif@umn.edu).

height="1.551388888888889in"}**Christelle Loiselet** has a PhD in Earth
Sciences from the University of Rennes. She is a geologist modeller with
experience in 3D geodynamics modelling and basin modelling applied to
georesources. Within BRGM, she works on 3D geological modelling and she
manages a research project on 3D Geo Information Systems. For the past
four years, she has lead the IT team working on developing IT systems to
deliver geological and mineral resources information using standards
such as O&M, GeoSciML and EarthRessourceML in national (RGF, BSS, Gaia
Data, etc) and international projects (EPOS, GeoERA, Mineral4EU, etc).
She is a member of the Form\@Ter executive board and she joined the CGI
council in 2020. Contact [Christelle](mailto:C.Loiselet@bgrm.fr).

![](/img/newsletter6/image6.jpeg){width="1.6736111111111112in"
height="1.6736111111111112in"}**Edd Lewis** is the Standards Lead at the
British Geological Survey, with responsibility of improving the
organisation and our partners data provision by using geospatial data
standards to better align with FAIR data principles (& hopefully driving
economic growth through improved data accessibility...).

 He is a member of the British Standard Institute IST/36 Geographic
Information committee, Association of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental
Specialists (AGS) AGS Data Format committee, MEDIN data standard
committee and contributor to ISO/TC 211 & OGC standards. Edd join the
CGI council in 2020. Contact [Edd](mailto:edlew@bgs.ac.uk).

CGI hosting DDE Standards Task Group

CGI leads the work of the IUGS Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) Standards
Task Group (DDE-STG) on implementing the use of CGI standards and
vocabularies by DDE and metadata for DDE. The CGI chair, Harvey
Thorleifson, was appointed as the Principal Investigator (PI) for the
DDE-STG with co-PIs Zhang Minghua, Alena Rybkina, François Robida, and
Tim Duffy.

Several CGI council members attended the DDE-STG meeting in January 2020
in Beijing. Currently, Francois Robida is sustaining his role in DDE-STG
supported by Zhang Minghua and Alena Rybkina (CODATA form Russia) as
co-chairs.

6th DDE Working Group Meeting at Suzhou

On 23-24 March 2021, co-leader of the DDE -STG Prof Zhang Minghua
accompanied by STG members Dr Liu Rongmei, Dr Ren Wei and Dr Zhang Sheng
attended the 6^th^ DDE working group meeting at Kunshan, Suzhou center
of DDE with a parallel meetings on DDE Standards and Knowledge.

DDE Standards working group meeting at the DDE Suzhou center.

Prof Zhang presented the DDE-STG work, achievements and 2021 work plan
based on the DDE-STG annual proposal, submitted in November 2020, on
behalf of the of DDE-STG. Four main activities for 2021 are:

-   DDE knowledge system review report;

-   Standards training courses;

-   DDE metadata standard (draft version);

-   Working Teams for DDE geosciences data standards.

The discussions included coverage of a variety of issues/topics such as
the DDE data and knowledge groups, geological timeline, global
1:5million map, Eurasian margin sea and DDE-China and CODATA roles on
open science facilities. Standards including metadata standards, DDE
standards architecture, and disciplinary specified standards, etc were
requested. These requests are critical and helpful, and will direct the
work of the DDE-STG.

*Prof Zhang at the DDE knowledge system group meeting.*

At the parallel meeting of the DDE Knowledge Group, Prof Zhang replied
on some common concerns about knowledge system/graph review procedure
from DDE working groups, like sedimentology, paleogeography and
petroleum geology working group, based on the first product of DDE-STG
"Formal Review Procedures for the Geoscience Knowledge System of IUGS
Deep-time Digital Earth Program (version of Aug 28,2020)". Zhang asked
these working groups to submit their comparison results of vocabulary
difference with CGI Geoscience Terminology to DDE-STG for a review.

The meeting was attened by 43 scientists, 23 on site and 20 virtually.
