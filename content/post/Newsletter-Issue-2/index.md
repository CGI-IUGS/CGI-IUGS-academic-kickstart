## New Members of CGI Council

Three new members have been elected to CGI Council to replace the recently retired Richard Hughes and to fill two other vacancies. We welcome [Kombada Mhopjeni](https://cgi-iugs.github.io/author/kombada-mhopjeni/) (Geological Survey of Namibia), [Zhang Minghua](https://cgi-iugs.github.io/author/dr-zhang-minghua/) (China Geological Survey), and Santiago Munoz (Geological Survey of the Dominican Republic).

## CGI Working Group News

[![Word map](/img/wordmap.jpg)](/images/newsletters/wordmap.jpg "Wordmap")

The [Geoscience Terminology Working Group]({{< ref "/project/GeoscienceTerminology/index.md" >}}), in collaboration with the [EarthResourceML Working Group]({{< ref "/project/EarthResourceML/index.md" >}}) recently approved the adoption of 18 new vocabularies to support delivery of mineral occurrence and mine data using the EarthResourceML data transfer standard. The vocabularies have been developed in collaboration with the European Union’s Minerals Intelligence Network for Europe (Minerals4EU), so that Minerals4EU vocabularies use either exactly the same terms or have mappings to CGI terminology. The vocabularies are to be published soon through the [CGI's vocabulary service](http://resource.geosciml.org "http://resource.geosciml.org").

## 3D Geological Data Models — a call for participants in a review of 3D standards

[![3D geological data model](/img/3d.jpg)](/img/3d.jpg "3D geological data model")

By nature, geological information is 3D (or even 4D). To date, CGI efforts to support geological data interoperability have focused on exchange of geological map and borehole information with GeoSciML and EarthResourceML, using GML as the underlying spatial data engine. With the growing demand for exchanging 3D geological models in many domains (eg, oil and gas, mining, groundwater, design of infrastructure), there is a clear need for standardizing the exchange of 3D models independently of the data format used by the modeling software.

There is currently no accepted generic exchange model for 3D geological models, although there have been some attempts in different organizations or projects. The CGI Council considers it a priority for the Commission to

*   review the current situation in the delivery of 3D geological models, and
*   propose a strategy for identifying or developing an agreed standard possibly in partnership with other standardization bodies.

We are now calling for volunteers to participate in an ad-hoc group to be setup in CGI on this topic. If you are interested, please email the CGI Chair, [Francois Robida](mailto:f.robida@brgm.fr).

## GeoSciML News

[![GeoSciML logo](/img/GeoSciML_logo.jpg)](http://www.geosciml.org/)

The joint OGC/CGI GeoSciML Standards Working Group (SWG) has recently held two teleconference meetings – one of them as part of the quarterly OGC Technical Committee meeting in Washington DC. Steve Richard provided a summary of his recent work to document the use cases needed for development of the GeoSciML version 4 standard. The working group will gather together in Tucson, USA from June 29 to July 3 for its annual face-to-face meeting. This will be held in conjunction with similar meetings of the EarthResourceML and Geoscience Terminology working groups, and the OneGeology Technical working group.

[A new user guide for GeoSciML data providers](http://www.geosciml.org/news_20142904_geoserver_cookbook.html) has also just been published by the [British Geological Survey](http://www.bgs.ac.uk) as part of their contribution to the EU INSPIRE initiative. The new user guide and other GeoSciML resources can be found on the [GeoSciML website](http://www.geosciml.org/ "http://www.geosciml.org/").

## News from China

![OneGeology logo](/img/onegeology.jpg)

A 1:1 million scale geological map of China has recently been released by the China Geological Survey as a contribution of China to the [OneGeology initiative](http://www.onegeology.org). The 1:1M geological map data cover most of the land areas of China and is now available as a OGC Web Map Service (WMS). Map layers include bedrock lithology, lithostratigraphy and major faults. For further information, contact your CGI councillor from China, [Zhang Minghua](mailto:zminghua@mail.cgs.gov.cn).

## News from Africa

![GIRAF logo](/img/giraf_logo.png)

The 25th Colloquium of African Geology will be held in conjunction with the 3rd Congress of the Young Earth Scientists network (YES) in August 2014, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. During the conference, the GIRAF Network and the Southern and Eastern African Mineral Centre (SEAMIC), is organising a session on geoscience information in Africa. Other conference participants are expected to include the Geological Society of Africa (GSAf), The African Association of Women Geologists (AAWG), OneGeology, AEGOS, and UNECA.

The geoscience information session will include presentations and discussions on the building of spatial data infrastructure in Africa, regional geoinformation initiatives; interoperability and standards; and best practices in delivery, dissemination and exploitation of geoscience information. Participants are encouraged to submit abstracts on their solutions and experiences of managing and delivering geoscience information to underpin public policy-making, investment, research and education. Contact the CGI secretary general and GIRAF coordinator [Kristine Asch](mailto:Kristine.Asch@bgr.de).

The Canadian [Groundwater Information Network](http://gin.gw-info.net/) (GIN) connects water well databases from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatche-wan, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, Nova-Scotia, and Yukon, and some key aquifer information from Natural Resources Canada.

The GIN [data analysis portal](http://analysis.gw-info.net/gin/public.aspx) enables users to view water wells and supporting hydrogeological maps in 2D and 3D, and to display and download geological well logs and water information from wells. The GIN makes use of the [GroundwaterML](http://ngwd-bdnes.cits.rncan.gc.ca/service/api_ngwds/en/gwml.html) data transfer standard for water wells and GeoSciML to deliver the downhole geological information.
