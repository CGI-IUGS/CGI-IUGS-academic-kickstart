Members of the EarthResourceML Working group met at IGME (the Spanish Geological Survey) in Madrid in May. L-R: Wang Yongzhi, Jouni Vuollo (chair), Mark Rattenbury, Ollie Raymond, Katarzyna Sadlowska, and Zhang Minghua.

The CGI Council and two of its standards working groups — Geoscience Terminology and EarthResourceML — convened in May in Madrid in conjunction with the [34th Geoscience Information Consortium](http://www.geology.cz/gic) (GIC) conference at the Spanish Geological Survey, IGME. Progress was made towards publishing several new geoscience vocabularies. Progress was also made towards publication of a new version of EarthResourceML (version 3.0), to address some issues identified by current users of the EarthResourceML v2.0 data transfer standard.
