Abstracts are invited to the special symposium [Advances in geoscience data sharing and processing](https://www.36igc.org/science-program) (Theme 45.10) at the 36th International Geological Congress (IGC). The symposium will highlight new techniques, standards, and algorithms for managing, delivering, visualising and analysing geoscience data both globally and regionally, including 'big' data. The symposium is jointly organised by CGI, IAMG, and OneGeology.
