# Introduction

The online geoscience standards training workshop for IUGS big science program Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) was held with great success on 26th -28th Oct., 2021. The training workshop was planned and organized by DDE standards task Group (DDE-STG) and DDE secretariat office. Addresses were delivered by representatives form DDE Science Committee prof Jennifer McKinley, chair of CGI-IUGS and leader of DDE-STG prof Harvey Thorleifson, vice president of CODATA and co-leader of DDE-STG Dr Alena Rybkina respectively, which introduced DDE program, DDE-STG work plan and CGI/OGC geoscience standards, and importance of open data policy. There were 93 registered and 152 attendees form DDE Working Groups and Task Groups (DDE-WTGs) and professional worldwide participated this training workshop. This 3-day training/workshop was chaired by co-leader of DDE-STG prof Zhang Minghua.

# The Workshop

Following the agenda on 26th Oct, Harvey Thorleifson presented a talk on Introduction to CGI and its main partners on geoscience standards, Francois ROBIDA and Mickael Beaufils delivered a talk on Introduction to CGI and OGC standards, Mark Rattenbury presented Geoscience Terminology with detail including semantic resolution cross standards, Boyan Brodaric and Steve Richard introduce Geoscience ontology and knowledge graph related studies. On 27th Oct, Oliver Raymond presented GeoSciML: Geology data model and exchange standard in detail, including content of GeoSciML 4.0 and its worldwide implementation, Michael Sexton talked on EarthResourceML: Mineral resource and mining data model and exchange standard in detail for application on mineral and mining industry, Zhang Minghua and Wang Yongzhi introduced DDE metadata standard draft with a prototype APP demonstration. On 28th Oct, James Passmore talked on Metadata standard and practice with stress on importance supporting FAIR data principle, James Passmore also introduced OneGeology data and standard technology with demonstration in detail. Alena Rybkina introduced CODATA FAIR data principles and GOFAIR practice, and Ma Xiaogang talked on A vision on DDE data science with FAIR data with an outlook at DDE data science. Questions, comments and discussions were also answered and exchanged among speakers and audiences the same time and after talks. Hot questions and common issues regarding standards for DDE data-driven discovery, Open data policy, cross disciplinary data exchange and artificial intelligence, and workforce coordination, etc. were discussed at the event.    

## Closing

At the closing ceremony, prof Harvey Thorleifson and prof Natarajan Ishwaran from DDE Executive Committee highly praised this training/workshop of great success both in systematically sharing in detail the tremendous knowledge, information, geoscience standards and current data sciences, including CGI, OGC, OneGeology, LOOP, CODATA, ISO/TC211 , 4D, linked data, and in its importance and great value to the IUGS DDE program. This training workshop will definitely help DDE WTGs greatly with standards and methodology in their work towards the data and knowledge driven discoveries in Earth science that implement DDE to achieve its goals.
