Nominations for CGI Council for 2020â€“24 are open. Any CGI member can nominate to serve on the council to help organise CGI's standards programme and the outreach activities of the CGI. Councillors must have support to be able to attend annual council meetings (the next one will be at the 36th IGC in Delhi in March 2020) and to devote time to implement CGI's mission.
