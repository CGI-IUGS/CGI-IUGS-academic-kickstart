[EarthResourceML-Lite](http://earthresourceml.org/) is a data model and schema for simple map services (e.g. WMS and WFS Simple Features). It is an abridged version of the full EarthResourceML model and can be used to deliver simplified views on mineral occurrences and their commodities, mines, mining activities and mine waste products.
