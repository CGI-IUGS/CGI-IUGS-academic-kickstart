# CGI-IUGS Website (www.cgi-iugs.org)

## Content
Content for this website is managed by the CGI council.

See Contacts below.

## Technical website operations
This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) *static site generator* website which means the source files are pretty much simplified HTML pages - [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)-formatted text files - which you can see stored in this repo. These are combined with a very simple template, the [wowchemy theme](https://wowchemy.com/) to add headers & footers to all pages and produce the final HTML web pages which are then delivered online with a web server. 

GitHub actions builds the site from this repo to https://github.com/CGI-IUGS/cgi-iugs.github.io which uses the built in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Running the site locally:

To run locally, install hugo v0.70 extended edition.
